## linux filesystem

* / - The root directory of the entire filesystem hierarchy, everything is nestled under this directory.
* /bin - Essential ready-to-run programs (binaries), includes the most basic commands such as ls and cp.
* /boot - Contains kernel boot loader files.
* /dev - Device files.
* /etc - Core system configuration directory, should hold only configuration files and not any binaries.
* /home - Personal directories for users, holds your documents, files, settings, etc.
* /lib - Holds library files that binaries can use.
* /media - Used as an attachment point for removable media like USB drives.
* /mnt - Temporarily mounted filesystems.
* /opt - Optional application software packages.
* /proc - Information about currently running processes.
* /root - The root user's home directory.
* /run - Information about the running system since the last boot.
* /sbin - Contains essential system binaries, usually can only be ran by root.
* /srv - Site-specific data which are served by the system.
* /tmp - Storage for temporary files
* /usr - This is unfortunately named, most often it does not contain user files in the sense of a home folder. This is meant for user installed software and utilities, however that is not   to say you can't add personal directories in there. Inside this directory are sub-directories for /usr/bin, /usr/local, etc.
* /var - Variable directory, it's used for system logging, user tracking, caches, etc. Basically anything that is subject to change all the time.
